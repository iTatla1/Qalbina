# Privacy Policy for Qalbina

**Last updated:** 07 July 2025

Qalbina (“the App”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Qalbina collects, uses, and safeguards your data. By using the App, you agree to the practices described below.

---

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

Qalbina is designed to respect your privacy. The app collects only minimal personal information, such as your name (entered during onboarding), mood selections, and journal entries. This data is:

- Stored locally on your device  
- Not transmitted, shared, or synced with any servers or third parties  
- Used solely to provide core app features such as mood tracking, journaling, and personalized user experience  

No personally identifiable information is collected beyond what you voluntarily enter in the app.

---

## 2. Local Storage and Device Privacy

All user-generated content (moods, journal entries, settings) is saved locally on your device. Qalbina does not use cloud storage, remote databases, or external analytics tools.

You have full control over your data. If you delete the app, all associated data is removed from your device.

---

## 3. No Data Sharing or Tracking

Qalbina does not share any personal data with third parties, advertisers, analytics platforms, or external services. The app contains:

- No third-party SDKs  
- No tracking tools  
- No advertisements  

Your activity within the app remains private and inaccessible to anyone but you.

---

## 4. Notifications

Qalbina may ask for permission to send local notifications as reminders for journaling or mood tracking. These notifications:

- Are generated and managed entirely on your device  
- Do not involve push notification services or external servers  
- Can be enabled or disabled by you at any time in system settings

## 5. Children’s Privacy

Qalbina is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has used the app inappropriately, please delete the app from the device.

---

## 6. Content Disclaimer

Qalbina provides daily prompts, reflections, and Islamic duas for the purpose of spiritual and emotional support. While we strive to ensure the content is respectful and accurate, it is not intended to serve as:

- Religious rulings  
- Clinical advice  
- Professional counseling  

The developers of Qalbina are not liable for any interpretations, emotional responses, or decisions made based on the in-app content.

Users are encouraged to consult qualified scholars, therapists, or professionals for personal, religious, or mental health guidance.

---

## 7. Security

Since Qalbina does not connect to the internet or collect server-based data, your information is inherently secure and protected by your device’s security features (e.g., Face ID, passcode). We encourage you to use your device’s privacy and backup features to maintain control of your data.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. If changes are made, the updated version will be included in the app or shown upon app update.
